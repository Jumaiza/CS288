It is based on our long experience as a suspension manufacturer and supplier for international motor sport, such as the touring car series ADAC GT Masters, FIA GT1, FIA GT3, International GT Open, WTC, VLN and the legendary ADAC Zurich 24h-race Nurburgring.By increasing the rebound force via the adjustment wheel body movements are reduced. You will have more stability during high speed cornering. If you change for example the wheel / tire combination (approved by the car manufacturer) to larger wheels, then with a KW coilover Variant 3 inox-line you will be able to adjust the car\'s handling perfectly.Print product descriptionThe KW coilover Variant 3 inox-line kit and every single damper are subject to extensive quality tests during production to meet the high standards of our KW quality management. This is the only way we can meet our expectations to give up to five years warranty on our KW coilover Variant 3 inox-line when installed at one of our KW specialist dealer. KW coilover struts made of stainless steel are 100% rust-free and an unlimited life time.Therefore the operation of the continuous lowering via the dirt-resistant KW trapezoid thread and the KW composite collar is also not affected after years. By the individual lowering with its continuous adjustment range, you can emphasize the sportiness of your vehicle visually. A feature that is very popular in the performance-oriented tuning scene.KW Variant 3 Coilover System features:AttributesThe KW coilover kit Variant 3 inox-line is the perfect accessory for performance-oriented drivers and tuning enthusiasts who put a great demand on their suspension. The separately rebound and compression damping adjustable dampers with their well-thought-through click adjustment allow a perfect setup. So it is easy to influence the steering behaviour, directional stability, tire grip and handling characteristics when driving on the limit.Important Part Information: Fitment Details: RC-FCutting-edge motorsports technology for more performance on the road. With independently adjustable compression and rebound damping the Variant 3 damper setup can be tuned to your own driving preferences or vehicle modifications such as weight, tire characteristics or additional chassis bracing. True performance optimization is only possible with this unique, patented system. For example, the compression damping force can be increased to optimize grip from the tires, or improve cornering behavior and reduce squat without influencing the rebound damping characteristics that are optimally tuned to the spring rate.The KW Variant 3 inox-line coilover kit is the ideal tool for performance-oriented drivers and experienced tuning enthusiasts who place a strong emphasis on the overall performance of their suspension. The Variant 3 features patented TVR-A and TVC-A technology that provides separately adjustable rebound and compression damping. The extensive adjustment range of the independently configurable rebound and compression make it easy to directly influence the steering behavior, directional stability, grip and handling characteristics for confident and repeatable results at the limit of driving dynamics.The two-stage, patented TVR-A (Twin Valve Rebound - Adjustable) technology enables a small volume of oil to flow through an adjustable, conically shaped, low-speed bypass during low damper speeds, while in the case of higher damper speeds, the main rebound stage valve opens allowing a larger volumn of oil to flow. This provides a big improvement in terms of ride comfort without influencing the safety-relevant high-speed range. There are 16 precise clicks available for individual settings, so you can choose between more comfort or more body control.With 12 precise clicks, the KW Variant 3 coilovers utilize TVC-A (Twin Valve Compression - Adjustable) technology and can increase or decrease the flow of valve to achieve either more or less low speed compression damping. During sudden high speed impulses the spring loaded needle valve and the spring loaded main valve open to their maximum valve cross section, acting as a digressive blow-off characteristic to avoid transmitting undesired forces through the suspension into the chassis. This provides a better platform for the vehicle body and at the same time offers more comfort than with conventional valve technology during high wheel acceleration. The dampers come preset to our baseline shock settings right out of the box providing an optimal starting place for your car while providing a wide adjustment window for true performance optimization.With KW Variant 3 coilovers you can achieve maximum lowering within an approved lowering range that ensures a proper functioning suspension with adequate travel after your car is lowered. Even after years of use you can easily adjust the ride height thanks to the dirt resistant trapezoid thread and composite adjustment collar.As with all KW coilovers our engineers develop vehicle specific damper and spring specifications which undergo comprehensive testing on the Nurburgring Nordschleife and in our KW 7-post Driving Dynamic Test Center. With a KW Variant 3 coilover kit the driving experience is more dynamic and direct. You are not buying a mass produced, generic coilover kit, a KW coilover has been developed specifically for your particular vehicle. As a manufacturer, KW uses only its own resources, high quality components and the damper technology that has all developed in-house. With the KW Variant 3 inox-line coilovers, rolling motion of the body will be reduced during compression giving you the benefit of more direct handling and confidence while driving.For over 20 years, KW automotive has been the market leader and driving innovation as a manufacturer of individual suspension solutions for the road and in all types of motorsports. No matter where in the world, gearheads, automobile manufacturers and reputable tuners rely on our KW coilovers Made in Germany. Every KW coilover kit undergoes extensive stress testing before production and is developed and manufactured exclusively in our company headquarters in Fichtenberg, a small in town in Germany, to meet the high standards of our KW quality management. For us as a German manufacturer, it goes without saying that our KW coilover kits will exceed the original equipment manufacturer quality, and offer useful and innovative solutions.
